FileGen is a text file generator that uses Jinja templates and YAML files to create files.  I created it because I kept running into the same problem, the need to have a 
template tool to create config files, kickstarts, etc that did not rely on tools like ansible or puppet.  I just needed to take a namespace from YAML/JSON files and 
Jinja templates (my language of choice) to render text files.


## Installation

The installation is simple enough from git, using standard setuptools conventions.  I will be publishing on PYPI as "FileGenerator" soon as well.
