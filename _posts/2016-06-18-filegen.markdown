FileGen
=======



## Universal text file generator

FileGen is a text file generator that uses Jinja templates and YAML files to create files.  I created it because I kept running into the same problem, the need to have a 
template tool to create config files, kickstarts, etc that did not rely on tools like ansible or puppet.  I just needed to take a namespace from YAML/JSON files and 
Jinja templates (my language of choice) to render text files.


## Namespace inheritance

FileGen can use multiple parameter files to load a chain into a single namespace when it comes time to render.  This is useful for things like kickstarts that have 
one template that has a bunch of global parameters captured in it that are site-wide and also a host parameters file that will only add the bits specific to that host.
This allows for clean, hierarchical parameters.


## Installation

The installation is simple enough from git, using standard setuptools conventions.  I will be publishing on PYPI as "FileGenerator" soon as well.  Try it out.  Let me know what you think.
