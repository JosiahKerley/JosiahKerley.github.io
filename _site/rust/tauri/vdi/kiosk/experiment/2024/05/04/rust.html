      <h2>Experimenting with Tauri</h2>
<p class="meta">04 May 2024</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/other/raspberry-pi-kiosk.png" alt="&quot;A kiosk in a store with folks walking by.&quot;" /></p>

<p>I’ve been toying around with the idea of creating a toolkit of sorts for creating kios based deployments
for Raspberry Pi’s on and off again for a while.  My brother and I have had a fascination with thin clients
and specifically using the Raspberry Pi as the hardware platform.  I’m no stranger to the Raspberry Pi (I think
I still have the original one that I accidentally fried hiding somewhere in my office) and it’s starting to feel
like it might be a viable platform for a project I’ve been thinking about.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-build">What I want to build</h2>
<p>I want to make an appliance image that can be built ahead of time and when booted, will launch a GUI application
on a minimal desktop environment.  The application must be fully captive of the system as far as user interaction,
but also minimally authorized to do what it needs to do.</p>

<p>Build a GUI app, have a build toolchain create an image with some basic network configuration and the app pre-installed.</p>

<p>Just Work (tm)</p>

<h2 id="why-tauri">Why Tauri?</h2>
<p>My first kneejerk reaction was to build an app in Qt, but I haven’t really used it in anger since v3.
The second thought was to use Swing, but similar to Qt, I haven’t used it in a good long while.
I toyed around with Electron a bit, but the backend lang was javascript (though nowadays I could use typescript)</p>

<p>That’s when I stumbled upon Tauri.  It’s a Rust based framework for building desktop applications similar in vein to Electron.
You don’t get the nice XML tools for building the UI like in Qt, but you can use web technologies to build the UI.</p>

<p>So far that’s more or less the same as Electron, but the big difference is that Tauri is that the backend is Rust.</p>

<h2 id="targeting-an-idea">Targeting an idea</h2>
<p>So, I think what I want to do use Tauri and Vue.js to build a simple application that a user can log into
and connect to a VDI.  I’m not going to go down the rabbit hole of implementing a vnc/rdp/spice/whatever,
but rather make the app a gossamer thin layer between a user sitting at a screen and a remote viewin application.</p>

<p>PiVDI?  I dunno, I’ll think of a name later.</p>
